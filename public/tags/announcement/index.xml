      <description>PyCon Pune 2017 was a grand success. Now, its time to set the tune for PyCon Pune 2018.
Since our first endeavor it has always been a community driven event and we wish to be so. To promote the goal, Sayan Chowdhury has announced the call for the design volunteers, helping in building our 2018 website. To give a shape to our 2018 edition we, the community at large, need to communicate.</description>
