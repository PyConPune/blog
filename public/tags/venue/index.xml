      <description>Over the last week we found out that the auditorium of COEP will not be available for the whole duration of PyCon Pune 2017. Due to the already action-packed schedule we were unable to adjust our schedule to meet the venue availability and we were forced to look for an alternate venue at the last moment.
After a lot of sleepless nights balancing budgets and tireless days running around looking for an alternate venue, we are happy to announce that our new venue for the main conference is AMANORA THE FERN Hotels and Club, in Amanora Park Town, Magarpatta Road, Hadapsar, Pune, 411028.</description>
