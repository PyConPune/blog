Welcome Katie Cunningham as our keynote speaker for PyCon Pune 2017

Katie Cunningham is a Python developer who is also a regular speaker,
teacher, and writer of technical books. When she's not cursing at
computers, Keynote, or poorly formatted chapters, she knits, sews, and
secretly writes fantasy books.

She is the CTO of Speak Agent, a company focused on helping kids learn
English through games. There, she creates iPad apps, websites, and
curses English grammar on a regular basis.

Katie lives in the DC area with her husband, two kids, and two dogs.
