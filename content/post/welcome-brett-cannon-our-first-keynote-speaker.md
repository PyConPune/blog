[PyCon Pune 2018](https://pune.pycon.org/2018/) is thrilled to welcome Brett Cannon, our first keynote speaker.

"Came for the language and stayed for the community" - our motto is the quote that actually originated the idea of having PyCon Pune. The lines which was used in two different Python Conferences of India in 2017. Therefore apart from Python, the love for this quote is also binding the Python Community in India. Now is the our chance to meet the person behind that thought, in PyCon Pune 2018.

We are fortunate to welcome [Brett Cannon](https://twitter.com/brettsky), as one of the keynote speakers. Brett is a CPython core developer and for his day job he works for Microsoft in their Visual Studio Code team. 

'PyCon' this word comes with different signifies different meaning, things to everyone.  To Brett, "PyCon serves three purposes. One is to learn about any trends going on in the Python community. Two is to meet new people. And three is getting to see friends I have made in this great community of ours".

He is specially excited about regional PyCons. Because regional PyCons offer a great chance to meet a different group of people who don't make it to the multi-national PyCons, but they are typically smaller and so feel more community-oriented”. Especially for PyCon Pune 2018 Brett is excited as this will fetch him the opportunity  of “Meeting new people”, knowing a new Python Community. Though he never has any specific plan for PyCon Pune 2018 but this CPython/Python enthusiast wants to work and help others to work "on CPython's workflow" and also "a few things involving importlib that I would like to try and get into Python 3.7". 
 
So you the Pythonista who wants to take the first step towards creating the language, stuck with your in your work in CPython, needs help regarding your project work, ideas or wants someone to guide you, mentor you this is your opportunity to get help from this ever helpful person.
